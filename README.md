### Hi, it's Pat :)

I'm a front-end developer and digital designer. I'm currently learning Vue.js and React!

Outside of tech, you'll see me volunteer for [Dev Edmonton Society](devedmonton.com) or [Ladies Learning Code](https://www.canadalearningcode.ca/). Or hanging out with my cat. Or watching a hockey game with my family. Or doing art. I do a lot of things
